movie recommender system using python. Built in VS - Code

Introducing my personal movie recommender project, meticulously crafted using Python. Leveraging advanced techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, matrix factorization, and cosine similarity, this project delivers personalized movie suggestions based on individual preferences. Dive into the world of cinema with ease, as this system simplifies the quest for your next favorite film. Explore the intersection of mathematics and machine learning in the realm of movie recommendations. 

I developed this movie recommender system as a passion project to explore the intersection of data science, machine learning, and personal interests. As a movie enthusiast myself, I often found it challenging to discover new films that aligned with my tastes. By creating this system, I aimed to streamline the process of finding recommendations tailored to individual preferences, while also delving into the fascinating world of recommendation algorithms and their application in real-life scenarios. Through this project, I not only expanded my skills in Python programming and machine learning but also enhanced my understanding of how data-driven approaches can enhance user experiences in various domains.

While successfully creating a recommendation system, it still slightly has some problems and isn't 100% accurate. Some things I would work on is to make it more precise and be able to differentiate movies by genres/actors/directors. Nonetheless, this was an exciting experience!
